# Prototype of New Decentralized Governance Model

## Using the example of the Decentralized Digital PostState (2DPS)

### Design of a Decentralized Digital PostState

- PostState is a digital tool that Citizens use to meet their economic, social, cultural and psychological needs
- PostState is Open Program Code, which is stored decentralized, on servers for which Validators are responsible
- The structure of the PostState is written in Open Software Code, and can be changed at the request of Citizens by participating in voting
- In a situation where a critical vulnerability is discovered, the PostState structure can be changed with the consent of 67% of Validators, without the participation of Citizens, but subsequently, Citizens can express dissatisfaction with the changes made and/or Validators


### Citizens and Voting Power

- All Citizens have 100% Voting Power
- The Voting Power of each of the Citizens is directly proportional to the value that the Citizen holds in the PostState
- Any of the Citizens can express Dissatisfaction with any Proposal, Decision, Actor, Validator or PostState Structure
- Citizens' Dissatisfaction has a cumulative effect, and if a Citizen has expressed his Dissatisfaction with something, then this Dissatisfaction will be taken into account until the Citizen withdraws her-his-it Dissatisfaction
- The Citizen's Dissatisfaction is a dynamic parameter, itâ€™s directly proportional to the Voting Power, and changes along with the change of Voting Power


### Actors

- The Actor is a Citizen who independently volunteered to create Proposals and implement Decisions, and also agreed to provide information about her-him-it-self in the public domain
- The Actor is a public person, and information about the Actor should be available to any Citizen
- The Actor can create Proposals and implement Decisions both independently and jointly with other Actors, as well as attract third-party experts and specialists
- The Group of Actors independently makes decisions about how they will formulate the Proposal, accept the Proposal and implement the Decision
- The Actor is responsible for her-his-it Proposals and Decisions primarily by reputation, but also, the Actor can guarantee an Additional Deposit
- The Actor is a Citizen, and she-he-it has a Voting Power, which is directly proportional to the value that the Actor holds in the PostState
- If the Actor gains (13% + Actor's voting Power) or more Citizens' Dissatisfaction, then the Actor's role is automatically removed
_Example:
If the Voting Power of the Actor is 0.53%, then in order to remove the Actor role, 13.53% or more Citizens must express their Dissatisfaction_


### Proposals and Decisions

- Any Proposals and Decisions must be open to Citizens and have a Consideration Time Period
- During the Consideration Period, Citizens can familiarize themselves with the Proposal and, if they want, express their Dissatisfaction
- Any Proposal that during Consideration Period has accumulated 13% or more of Citizens' Dissatisfaction is automatically rejected
- A Proposal that has received less than 13% of Citizens' Dissatisfaction during Consideration Period is considered accepted and can proceed to the implementation of the Decision
- The process of Decision implementing must be open to Citizens, and any Citizen can express Dissatisfaction with both the implementation of the Decision and the Decision itself
- If during Decision implementation it accumulates 21% or more of Citizens' Dissatisfaction, the implementation of the Decision automatically stops
- If the implemented Decision accumulates 25% or more of Citizens' Dissatisfaction, such a Decision is automatically canceled


### Example of Decentralized PostState Governance

1. Citizens have an Idea or Proposal for any changes or innovations. Such a Citizen can either voluntarily provide information about her-him-it-self in the public domain and take on the role of an Actor, or submit her-his-it idea/proposal to existing Actors for consideration
2. An Actor (or a group of Actors) forms a Proposal from an idea and submits the Proposal for consideration
3. If the Proposal does not gain 13% or more of Citizens' Dissatisfaction during the Consideration Period, then it goes into the implementation phase of the Decision
4. If during implementation the Decision does not accumulate 21% or more of Citizens' Dissatisfaction, it is considered implemented
5. The implemented Decision can be canceled if it accumulates 25% or more of Citizens' Dissatisfaction

_It is necessary to understand that there are a number of Decisions that cannot be completely reversed.
For example, if, according to the Decision, funds were sent to an address to which no one has access, then this Decision can be canceled, but it will not return the funds.
Each of these cases must be considered individually, either by a group of Actors, or a group of Dissatisfied Citizens_
