# Functionality of the Decentralized Digital Poststate
## A digital tool for solving real problems

At the moment, the Poststate has the following functionality:
- Economic
- Social
- Education
- Entertainment
- Security
- Conflict Resolution
- Privacy
- External Interaction

Let’s dive into Poststate Functionality to understand how it works!

# Economic Functionality
## The economy must be neutral

The task of the Decentralized Digital Poststate is not to regulate or impose an economic model, but to create a safe space for economic interaction for Citizens and Users

The Poststate cannot block or freeze anyone’s funds, and generally has no punishment functionality

At the same time, the Poststate has an incentive function for Citizens, which is expressed in the Unconditional Income for Citizens, as well as in the issuance of microcredits for Citizens whose economic activity contributes to the economy of the entire Poststate

The economic functionality of the PS includes:

- Moving tokens from address to address
- Creation and replenishment of Liquidity Pools
- P2P exchange of tokens between Citizens and/or Users
- Exchange of tokens in Liquidity Pools
- Ability to create Private Tokens (only for Citizens)
- Ability to create NFTs in various formats
- Getting Unconditional Income (only for Citizens)
- Tax collection of 0.5% from each exchange
- Issuance of microcredits (only for Citizens)
- Interchain exchange
- The economic token of the Poststate is called Unit ($UNIT)

All transactions within the Poststate are accompanied by the payment of a transaction fee in $UNIT

# Taxes in the Poststate

Each exchange carried out by a Citizen or User within the Poststate is taxed at 0.5%:
- 0.2% goes to the Validator Pool to support Poststate Security
- 0.1% goes to the Community Pool (Budget) for the implementation of Poststate Governance
- 0.2% distributed among Citizens as Unconditional Income

The tax is levied on those tokens that participate in the exchange

If an indivisible NFT is involved in the exchange, then a tax of 0.5% is charged in $UNIT, by the market price of NFT at the moment of exchange.

The tax is included in the transaction fee

When exchanging one NFT for another NFT, no tax is charged, since it is not possible to know the market value of NFT at the moment of the exchange

# Private Money

For economic interaction, the Poststate allows Citizens to use both the $UNIT internal economic token and Private Tokens

Any Citizen can issue Private Tokens for their own services

Since some services are difficult to compare directly (for example, it is not clear how to compare Psychological Support Tokens with Designer Service Tokens), the Citizen who issues Private Tokens can equate them to the $UNIT Economic Token

### Example:

Alice issues Private Token $PTA for developer services, where each token is equivalent to 1 hour of code development.
Bob issues Private Token $PTB for designer services, where each token is equivalent to 1 hour of design creation.
Alice list her $PTA tokens on a P2P exchange at a price of:
1 $PTA = 3 $UNIT
Bob lists his $PTB tokens on a P2P exchange at a price of:
1 $PTB = 2 $UNIT
The program code of the Poststate automatically compares the value of Alice’s and Bob’s tokens, and allows Alice and Bob to conduct economic interaction with their tokens in the ratio 1 $PTA = 1.5 $PTB
If Alice or Bob do not fulfill their obligations on their personal tokens, then no one acquires their tokens. And this can be seen from the nature of the transactions.
If Alice or Bob fulfill their obligations on their tokens, then they can count on support from the Poststate for issuing microcredits.

# Unconditional Income

All profits of the Poststate are the distributed property of the Citizens, and must be distributed among the Citizens

The distribution of Poststate income among Citizens is called Unconditional Income, and this motivates Citizens to contribute to the development of the Poststate, since their Unconditional Income increases quantitatively along with the growth of Poststate income

The economic value of the Poststate is measured in the number of transactions within the Poststate, as well as in the number of exchanges made within the Poststate

The contribution to the economic development of the Poststate is measured in the number of $UNIT economic tokens that the Citizen holds inside the Poststate in Liquidity Pools

A citizen can provide liquidity to the Liquidity Pools in pairs with $UNIT, after which the percentage of $UNIT economic tokens held to the total amount of all $UNIT economic tokens held can be calculated.
In accordance with this percentage, the Citizen receives an Unconditional Income

Also, the percentage of retained $UNIT economic tokens is equivalent to the Citizen’s Voice Power, which is taken into account when expressing dissatisfaction with the accepted Proposals, or when expressing disagreement with the participation of one or another Citizen in the Poststate Governance

# Social Functionality
## Decentralized Governance Model

The Decentralized Digital Poststate is under the Decentralized Governance of Citizens

Any Citizen can take part in the Poststate Governance, and then she-he-it will receive an additional Governor status, which gives both extended opportunities and additional responsibility

Poststate Governance can create any Proposals and vote on Proposals

The Voice Power of each of the Governors is directly proportional to the number of $PHMN governance tokens held out of the total number of $PHMN governance tokens held

Citizens who don’t want to participate in the Poststate Governance, but own $PHMN governance tokens, can delegate them to one or more Governors at their discretion.
There is no reward for delegating $PHMN governance tokens to Governors, and this an action is a personal matter of the Citizen.
No one can force a Citizen to delegate $PHMN governance tokens to Governors

Citizens can evaluate any of the Governors, as well as any Proposal accepted by the Poststate Governance at any time

In case that 13% or more of the Citizens don’t agree with the Accepted Proposal (even if the Proposal has already start to work) — the Proposal is rejected.

In case that 13% or more of the Citizens are not satisfied with any Governor— such a Governor is deprived of the status of a Governor and leaves the Poststate Governance

Thus, the Poststate doesn’t waste time and resources on holding elections of participants in the Poststate Governance — any Citizen can easily become a Governor.
But the Citizen will be in the Poststate Governance until 13% or more of the Citizens speak out against the Governor
Each of the Citizens may at any time vote against the participation of any Governor, or vote against the Accepted Proposal.
Also, each of Citizens may also withdraw their vote Against at any time

The Poststate functionality displays the number of votes Against for each of the Governors and for each Proposal:

- As soon as the Governor gains 13% or more votes Against, the Governor automatically loses the status of the Governor
- As soon as the Proposal gains 13% or more votes against — the Proposal is rejected, and everything returns to the moment before decisions are made, if possible
- If the Proposal has been in effect for a long time, and the consequences of the accepted Proposal have already changed the situation so that it cannot be returned to its value before the Proposal is accepted, then the Poststate Governance must accept new Proposals, against which no more than 13% of Citizens will oppose

The threshold of 13% is taken as the starting value for the functioning of Decentralized Governance, and can be changed to a larger or smaller one solely by the will of the Citizens, by voting on the Proposal to change the Decentralized Governance Model.
At least 75% of Citizens must take part in such a vote, and at the same time, at least 75% of those participating in the vote must vote in favor of changing the parameters of the Decentralized Governance Model

## Committees

Poststate Governance can create an unlimited number of Committees to resolve issues related to a narrow specialty

Questions that require certain competencies should be decided by Committees, which consist of people with the necessary competencies

In other words, marketing-related issues should be decided by a Committee of Marketers, while code-related decisions should be made by Committees of Developers

- The number of Committees is not limited
- The composition of the Committee is determined by those wishing to create a Committee
- The Committee can include both Users and Citizens, as well as any person or digital entity that has the necessary competencies in the field of the Committee’s activities
- The Committee decides on its own, and on the terms that the Committee considers best for making a decision
- Any decision of the Committee is accepted, as long as the Poststate Governance has not expressed a desire to reject the decision of the Committee

- If anyone from the Poststate Governance has expressed a desire to reject the decision of the Committee — a Proposal to Reject the decision of the Committee is rised
- If the Proposal to Reject passes — then the decision of the Committee will be rejected

The Poststate proceeds from the fact that the Committee consists of a small number of people who have competencies in their field, which means that a small circle of professionals is able to make a decision that will not cause dissatisfaction among Citizens

If it takes at least 13% of dissatisfied Citizens to reject the Proposal from the Poststate Governance, then in the case of Committees:
any decision of the Committee can be rejected by the dissatisfaction of at least 7% of Citizens

The Decentralized Governance Model can be changed by the Poststate Governance, but the decision made by the Poststate Governance can be revoked if 13% or more of the Citizens oppose such a decision

# Educational Functionality
## Knowledge is power!

The Decentralized Digital Poststate is interested in the self-education of the entire Humanity, therefore the Poststate incentivizes self-education of both Citizens and Users on an equal basis

Poststate doesn’t have the ability to force or tell Citizens and Users what and how they need to study

Citizens and Users themselves choose the areas of self-education in which they would like to achieve the desired results or acquire the desired skills

To motivate Citizens and Users to engage in self-education, the Educational Functionality Learn-To-Earn (L2E) is implemented in the Poststate

Any complex skill or knowledge is made up of a large number of easy skills or knowledge.
To master a complex skill or knowledge, one must learn many easy skills or knowledge.

To make self-education not only useful, but also interesting, the acquisition of any complex skill or knowledge can be turned into a game process:
A complex skill or knowledge is broken down into many small skills or knowledge, which are arranged in a tree of knowledge, where the acquisition of several easy skills or knowledge leads to the acquisition of more complex skills or knowledge.

### Example:

Thus, the acquisition of any skill or knowledge can be turned into a game, so Citizens or Users who decide to educate themselves acquire the additional status of a Gamer

Completing easy tasks not only earns skills and rewards for Gamers, but also opens up the possibility for them to take on more difficult tasks

By completing tasks in stages, Gamers receive rewards for each completed task.
The more difficult the task, the higher the reward for completing the task.
Other Gamers, Bots and/or Artificial Intelligence can be responsible for checking the completed task, and in some cases, the provided result is in itself proof of the completed task

Gamers can propose the creation of new tasks in a manner similar to the creation of Pool Request at GitHub mixed with Reddit functionality:
Any Gamer can propose the creation of a new task, and other Gamers can “up” or “lower” this proposal.
Those offers that rise above other offers are added to the list of tasks for self-education, and a reward is allocated for the completion of such tasks

Rewards for self-education can be provided by the Poststate, Citizens, Users, or other Gamers

Third-party projects that are outside the Poststate can also create tasks, setting a reward for them in their own tokens

### Example:

1) A new Blockchain Project from the Cosmos Ecosystem needs to create a website
2) Blockchain Project creates a task and sets a reward for its execution
3) The “Create a Website” task is divided into a large number of sub-tasks:
- Find a website building app
- Learn the guide on how to use the app
- Create a one-page site in the application
- Create a multi-page site in the application
- ….
- Create a website at the request of the Blockchain Project
4) In the process of completing small tasks, moving from simple to more complex, the Gamer will complete the task and receive a reward from the Blockchain Project, while the Blockchain Project will receive the site they wanted

All task rewards are subject to a 0.5% tax, which is used to governance the Poststate, to provide security for the Poststate, and to provide Unconditional Income to Citizens

# Entertainment Functionality
## Living in the Poststate is Interesting and Fun!

The Decentralized Digital Poststate takes care of the cultural leisure of Citizens and Users, and has cross-game functionality, as well as provides interactive content

The Entertainment Functionality of the Poststate allows the Gamers not only to participate in the Game, but also to receive rewards for winning (Win-To-Earn)

Championships are held among the Gamers, in which championship Sponsors provide rewards to the winners

Gamers receive rewards in the $GATO cultural-game token, which they can exchange for Sponsor Tokens or hold onto them to vote for Sponsors of subsequent championships

The Entertainment Functionality of the Poststate allows the Gamers to fully govern the Game, change the rules of the Game, choose Sponsors of the Game and earn rewards in the process of entertainment

All rewards are subject to a 0.5% tax, which is used to manage the Poststate, to provide the security of the Poststate, and to provide Unconditional Income to the Citizens

The initial cross-game functionality is provided by the Cross-Gaming Metaverse — Metarchy

In addition to Metarchy, the Cross-Gaming Metaverse includes:
- HoneyWood
- Lorem Ipsum
- Cosmos Chicken Coop
The number of games connected to Cross-Gaming Synchronization will constantly increase

Cross-Gaming Synchronization is a completely new phenomenon that was impossible to implement in Web2

The innovation lies in the fact that achievements in one of the Games connected to the Cross-Gaming Synchronization are taken into account in other Games.
In other words, an artifact or hero from one Game can be used in another Game.

Thanks to Web3 (Wallet Connect), the Gamers can join Games from Cross-Gaming Synchronization from one address, and the Game reads data from the address and displays the Gamer’s achievements

The more Games connected to Cross-Gaming Synchronization, the more opportunities the Gamers have, and the more interesting it is for the Gamers to move from one Game to another Game, carrying with them the experience they have already gained, while getting new sensations and pleasure from changing gameplay

Games that connect to Cross-Gaming Synchronization benefit from the fact that they immediately receive an influx of Gamers from other Games that are already in Cross-Gaming Synchronization

In addition to Games, the Entertainment Functionality of the Poststate includes Interactive Content

When viewing Interactive Content, the User receives an NFT, which indicates the number of her-his-it viewing:

With NFT-view, Users can govern content by creating and voting on Proposals, such as incorporating advertisements into content
Advertisement generates a profit that is distributed among the owners of NFT-views
Earlier NFT-views on these videos will be worth more than later NFT-views, creating a market for NFT-views and allowing Users to earn from their views
The functionality of Interactive Content will be implemented in the Poststate thanks to the OmniFlix Network

# Security
## Proof-of-Time

The security of the Decentralized Digital Poststate is based on a modified Tendermint consensus and is provided by the Validators

In the Poststate, Validators are exempt from both network governance and irrational competition for Delegators, since the reward for providing security doesn’t come from the Delegators, but from the Validators Pool

Funds in the Validators Pool come from each transaction in the network in the form of a transaction fee, as well as from taxation:
0.2% of all exchanges and rewards go to the Validators Pool

Funds from the Validators Pool are distributed among the Validators in direct proportion to the number of $LOCK security tokens owned by the Validator

The Validator receives 1 $LOCK for each block that the Validator has validating
If the Validator misses a block, then the Validator doesn’t receive the $LOCK security token
In other words, each of the Validators receives $LOCK tokens based on its uptime:
Every 10,000 blocks, each Validator’s percentage of the total amount of $LOCK security tokens is calculated, and on this basis, funds are distributed from the Validator Pool

### Example:

10 Validators validate the Network

After 10.000 blocks:
- 6 of Validators closed 10.000 blocks, and each of them got 10.000 $LOCK
- 4 of Validators closed 5.000 blocks, and each of them got 5.000 $LOCK

Total amount of $LOCK is equal:
6*10.000 + 4*5.000 = 60.000 + 20.000 = 80.000 $LOCK — that is equal to 100% of Validators Pool shares

Program will count share of each Validator:
- 10.000 $LOCK is 12.5% of Validators Pool shares (10.000/80.000=0.125)
- 5.000 $LOCK is 6.25% of Validators Pool shares (5.000/80.000=0.0625)

From all the taxes and fees, after 10.000 blocks, the Validators Pool gained 100 $ATOM, 1.000 $UNIT and 5.000 $GATO

Distribution of funds from the Validators Pool:
- 6 of Validators will get 12.5 $ATOM + 125 $UNIT + 625 $GATO each
- 4 of Validaots will get 6.25 $ATOM + 62.5 $UNIT + 312.5 $GATO each

That is, the reward of the Validator directly depends on the time that the Validator spent on providing security to the Poststate.
This motivates Validators to put in their best effort to achieve 100% uptime, and liberates Validators from pointless competition for Delegators at the expense of Network security

Also, this motivates Validators not to draw attention to themselves, but to draw the attention of Users to the functionality of the Poststate, which has a positive effect not only on the security of the Poststate, but also reduces the number of conflict situations that arise due to the irrational competition of Validators for Delegators

The Poststate cannot forbid anyone to run the Validator, and if a dishonest User will run a validator, the Poststate Governance can distribute $LOCK security tokens from the Community Pool to respectable Validators, which will significantly increase the profitability of respectable Validators, and at the same time reduce the profitability of dishonest Validators, making their income is lower than the cost of maintaining the infrastructure

# Conflict Resolution
## Decentralized Arbitration Courts

The Decentralized Digital State should help Citizens quickly and efficiently resolve any disputes

If a dispute arises between Citizens or Users that cannot be written in the code of the Poststate, then the conflicting parties can use the functionality of the Decentralized Arbitration Court
The Decentralized Arbitration Court can take various forms, and the best option is when the conflicting parties come to a consensus on the form of the Decentralized Arbitration Court

If the conflicting parties cannot reach a consensus on the form of the Decentralized Arbitration Court, then the classic form of the Decentralized Arbitration Court will be used:
- Side A chooses three judges who are of interest to Side A
- Side B chooses three judges who represent the interests of Side B
- Three more Judges are elected by the conflicting parties on the basis of consensus, or, if consensus is not possible, then they are elected at random.
In this case, each of the parties may refuse Judges selected from random, which will initiate a new set of Judges from random, until both parties agree with the set of Judges from random

A set of nine Judges considers the conflict situation and makes its decision by closed voting: each of the Judges chooses the side that he considers right in the conflict situation, after which he sends his decision in encrypted form.
When all the Judges have made a decision, the results are revealed, and the side that the majority of the Judges considers right in the conflict situation wins the Decentralized Arbitration Court

In the event that one of the parties loses the Decentralized Arbitration Court by 1 vote (4 Judges — For, 5 judges — Against), such a party may request a retrial, where the number of Judges from random will be increased from 3 to 5.
In case of repeated loss of the Decentralized Arbitration Court with a difference of 1 vote (5 Judges — For, 6 Judges — Against) — such a party may request a third trial, where the number of judges from random will be increased from 5 to 7.
This procedure may be repeated until the difference between the For and Against votes exceeds 1 vote

In the event of a final loss, where the difference between the For and Against becomes 2 or more votes, the losing party must accept the decision of the Decentralized Arbitration Court

Also, any conflict situations can be submitted for consideration by the Poststate Governance, with the mutual consent of the conflicting parties.
The decision taken by the Poststate Governance may be rejected in case of dissatisfaction of 13% or more of the Citizens

# Privacy
## The Right, Not a Privilege

The Decentralized Digital Poststate is created to protect the rights and interests of Citizens. The Poststate considers Privacy as a right and interest of Citizens

- The Poststate doesn’t collect and is not interested in any personal information about Users and Citizens
- The Poststate cannot and should not have the functionality to distribute personal information to third parties
- The Poststate cannot and should not collect personal data of Users and Citizens, while the Poststate cannot in any way influence the actions of Users, Citizens or third parties to collect data about Users or Citizens
- If the Poststate has any opportunity to distribute personal information about Users or Citizens to third parties, the Poststate must be Reformatted
- Users and Citizens should independently take care of their information security, and not distribute personal information to third parties
- In order to distinguish between Users and Citizens, the User (only be the own will), can provide the Poststate with information about the possession of Digital Citizenship.
- In this case, the Poststate will consider such a User as a Citizen, providing the Citizen with extended functionality that is not available to an ordinary User (for example, issuing Private Tokens and receiving Unconditional Income)

If someone asks the Poststate to provide any information about Users or Citizen, then the Poststate should not only refuse to provide any information, but also should try to inform the User or Citizen about who and for what purpose interested in personal information about User or Citizen

If the Poststate, as a result of unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the Poststate, becomes the owner of the Citizen’s personal information, then the Poststate must delete this information (if it’s possible) and inform the Citizen:
- which Citizen’s personal information has become known to the Poststate
- how this information has become known to the Poststate
- what the Poststate has done with this information

If personal information that came to the Poststate as a result of unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the Poststate contains a threat to the security of the Poststate (for example, information about who and how found a vulnerability in the code and took advantage of this vulnerability) — the Poststate must bring this information to the Validators, get rid of the vulnerability, and then delete this information (if it’s possible)

In the event that a User or a Citizen receives an additional status, such as a Governor, Validator or Gamer, the Poststate must receive additional personal information that is related both to expanding the functionality of the Governor, Validator or Gamer, as well as to expanding the responsibilities of the Governor, Validator or Gamer

Citizens have the right to request information about Governors and Validators from the Poststate, and the Poststate must to provide information to Citizens about Governors and Validators

# External Interaction
## We have come to reach a consensus

The Decentralized Digital Poststate is a synchronization of people and digital entities, which means that it shares all international norms of Human Rights, and also protects the Rights of Digital Entities on the world stage

For External Interaction, Poststate Governance can create an unlimited number of Committees for negotiations with other projects, classical states and/or supranational institutions

Such Committees have the full right to negotiate on behalf of the Poststate

The Poststate Governance or at least 7% of dissatisfied Citizens can close such a Committee and cancel any agreements at any time, after which it is necessary to create a new Committee on External Interaction, which will include people and digital entities that Governors and/or Citizens will not oppose

All requests and proposals from other projects, classical states or supranational institutions can be addressed to the Poststate Governance, and their request will be forwarded to the Committee, which has taken responsibility for External Interaction

The Poststate respects the sovereignty of the classical states and their legislation, and therefore counts on the respect of the sovereignty and legislation of the Poststate by the classical states and supranational institutions

Poststate Citizens live in the territories of the classical states, and the place of residence of the Poststate Citizens is under the protection of the Poststate

The Poststate considers the place of residence of the Poststate Citizens as representative offices and/or embassies of the Poststate in the territories of the classical states

All digital property of the Poststate Citizens (private keys, passwords, any other data in digital form), as well as digital data carriers and means of accessing the Internet (mobile devices, tablets, laptops, computers) are protected by the Poststate

Any seizure of digital property, digital data carriers, or means of accessing the Internet from Poststate Citizens will be considered as a direct threat to the security of the Poststate

If the representatives of the classical state need to enter the territory of the representative office and/or embassy of the Poststate in order to seize the digital property and/or digital data carriers of the Poststate Citizens, then in this case, the classical states should first send a request to the Poststate Governance or the Committee on External Engagement, in which to explain a reason for committing actions that directly threaten the security of the Poststate Citizens and the Poststate itself

The Poststate Governance or the Committee on External Engagement should consider the request from the classical state as soon as possible:

In case the reasons don’t correspond to the desired actions on the part of the classical state, the request must be denied
If the reasons are not comparable to the potential threat to the security of the of the Poststate Citizens and the Poststate itself, the request must be denied
If the reasons outweigh the potential threat to the safety of the Poststate Citizens and the Poststate, the request must be accepted
The decision of the Poststate Governance or the Committee on External Engagement can be overturned by the dissatisfaction of 13% or 7% of the Citizens, respectively.

The main areas of cooperation between the Poststate, classical states and supranational institutions:
- Providing new Decentralized Governance Models
- Recognition of the sovereignty of the Poststate by classical states and supranational institutions
- Recognition of Digital Documents of Poststate Citizens
- Protection of the rights of Poststate Citizens located in the territories of classical states

Priority areas of cooperation between the Poststate, classical states and supranational institutions:
- Protection of Human Rights
- Protecting the Rights of Digital Entities
- Global Risk Prevention
- Prevention of Military Conflicts
- Solving Environmental Problems
- Education in the field of High Technologies
- Rejuvenation and Unlimited Life Extension (development of “cure for ageing”)
